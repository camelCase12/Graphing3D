# Graphing3D
Graphing using C# built-in graphics

Most of my code is contained in Graphing3D/Graphing3D/3DBehaviors

Modify the function on line 66 of Graphing3D/Graphing3D/3DBehaviors/Graphing/GraphHandler.cs to change the function being graphed. Return a z value corresponding to x and y variables. timeElapsed can be used as an additional parameter to give the graph a time progression.
